# 1. Use chatgpt to walk through including ATTinycore in your IDE
# 2. Follow the instructions in Arduino as ISP before next steps
# 3. Once done, connect a 10uF capacitor from arduino Reset pin to Ground with the stripe facing groound
# 4. Connect the pins as follows:
#      Arduino pin 13 to ATTiny pin 9 (SCK)
#      Arduino pin 12 to ATtiny pin 8 (MISO)
#      Arduino pin 11 to ATtiny pin 7 (MOSI)
#      Arduino pin 10 to ATtiny pin 4 (RESET)
#      Arduino 3.3V to ATtiny pin 1 (VCC)
#      Arduino GROUND to ATTiny pin 14 (GROUND)
